Project Title: Movie Ratings Analysis

Objective:
Analyze a movie ratings dataset to extract insights using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. This project focuses on data manipulation, filtering, and basic analysis.


Dataset:
Use a small movie ratings dataset (e.g., 
[IMDB Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) or a sample dataset like [MovieLens](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/movie-lens-dataset)).


Project Tasks:

1. Basic Python and NumPy
- Task 1.1: Load the dataset and explore it using basic Python and NumPy.
  - Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for ratings.
  - Use NumPy arrays for numerical computations.
- Task 1.2: Filter the dataset to find:
  - Movies with ratings above a certain threshold (e.g., 4 stars).
  - Movies from a specific year or genre.


2. Pandas for Data Handling
- Task 2.1: Use Pandas to:
  - Read and manipulate the dataset.
  - Handle missing data (if any).
  - Sort and filter movies based on ratings or genres.
- Task 2.2: Group movies by genre or year and calculate average ratings for each group.
